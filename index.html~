      <b>ABOUT</b>
      <br>The Somerville Yogurt Making Coop, SGMC offers hyper-local granola made with ingredients from small local farms, honey from our very own Somerville bees and dry-rolled oats.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>COST</b>
      <br>Members can sign up to receive between one and eight pounds of granola each month. Membership terms are for six months and cost $24 for a one pound share. This works out to $4.00 per pound.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>WORK</b>
      <br>One Tuesday a month two members make granola for the whole group. Start times are flexible and the whole process takes about three hours. The number of times each member makes granola during their term is dependent on the number of
      members in the coop and the number of pounds of
	  granola that member receives. At present, members
	  who receive up to two pounds of granola make
	  granola once during their six month term. Members
	  who receive up to four pounds make granola twice.
      For each additional two pounds, members add one shift.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>LOCATION</b>
      <br>The co-op uses a shared kitchen in First Church Somerville, just outside of Davis Sq. to make, store and distribute shares. Members are given direct access to the church. Pick up times are Wednesday through Sunday of the same week that the granola
      is made.

      <b>GRANOLA</b>

      <br>
Our granola is made with ingredients from local farms with transparent and sustainable farming practices. Most notably our oats are organically farmed and dry rolled in Maine. Chances are you have never experienced dry-rolled oats. Dry-rolled oats have a raw and natural texture in contrast to the uniform flake of conventional steamed rolled oats. Steam rolling is used as method for extending the shelf life of oats by removing their natural enzymes. It is an energy intensive process and almost all steam rolled oats are processed in a single plant in Saskatchewan, Canada. By contrast, the simple process of dry rolling raw oats is affordable for small batch processing and results in a product that is better for farms, the environment and you.

      Second our oil is cold pressed. The standard process for refining oils is referred to as solvent extraction and a full description of this process is not for the faint of heart or stomach. The process includes extreme heat, hexane-based solvents, bleaching and deodorization. The process damages the fats in the oil to the extent that the oil is often rancid before it is even sold. Not only is our oil extracted from a simple cold press, but it is made from non-GMO seed and sourced 30 percent from local farms.  

      <br><br>
Finally, our cranberries contain no artificial color or preservatives typical of commercially processed cranberries and retain the dark rich color, tart flavor and moist taste of the original cranberry.

Below is a complete list of our ingredients. Note that our recipe does not contain nuts and the kitchen we use is designated nut-free.
