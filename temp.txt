Our granola is made with ingredients from local farms with transparent and sustainable farming practices. Most notably our oats are organically farmed and dry rolled in Maine. Chances are you have never experienced dry-rolled oats. Dry-rolled oats have a raw and natural texture in contrast to the uniform flake of conventional steamed rolled oats. Steam rolling is used as method for extending the shelf life of oats by removing their natural enzymes. It is an energy intensive process and almost all steam rolled oats are processed in a single plant in Saskatchewan, Canada. By contrast, the simple process of dry rolling raw oats is affordable for small batch processing and results in a product that is better for farms, the environment and you. 

Second our oil is cold pressed. The standard process for refining oils is referred to as solvent extraction and a full description of this process is not for the faint of heart or stomach. The process includes extreme heat, hexane-based solvents, bleaching and deodorization. The process damages the fats in the oil to the extent that the oil is often rancid before it is even sold. Not only is our oil extracted from a simple cold press, but it is made from non-GMO seed and sourced from local farms.

Finally, our cranberries contain no artificial color or preservatives typical of commercially processed cranberries and retain their dark rich color, tart flavor and moist taste of the original cranberry.
