<h1>ABOUT</h1>

<p>The Somerville Granola Making Coop (SGMC) offers
granola made with ALL local ingredients including
dry-rolled oats from Maine and cold press oil from
Vermont.</p>

<h1>COST</h1>

<p>Members can sign up to receive between one and eight pounds of granola each
month. Membership terms are for six months and cost $24 for a one pound share.
This works out to $4.00 per pound.</p>

<h1>WORK</h1>

<p>Each member is responsible for signing up to help make granola twice during
their six-month term. Granola is made once a month on Tuesday evenings.  Start
times are flexible and the whole process takes about three hours.<p>

<h1>LOCATION</h1>

<p>The co-op uses a shared kitchen in First Church Somerville, just outside of
Davis Sq. to make, store and distribute shares. Members are given direct access
to the church. Pick up times are Wednesday through Sunday of the same week that
the granola is made.</p>

<h1>GRANOLA</h1>

<p>Our granola is made with ingredients from <strong>local farms</strong> with
transparent and sustainable farming practices. Most notably our oats are
organically farmed and <strong>dry rolled</strong> in Maine. Chances are you
have never experienced dry-rolled oats. Dry-rolled oats have a raw and natural
texture in contrast to the uniform flake of conventional steamed rolled oats.
Steam rolling is used as method for extending the shelf life of oats by
removing their natural enzymes. It is an energy intensive process and almost
all steam rolled oats are processed in a single plant in Saskatchewan, Canada.
By contrast, the simple process of dry rolling raw oats is affordable for small
batch processing and results in a product that is better for farms, the
environment and you.</p>

<p>Second our oil is <strong>cold pressed</strong>. The standard process for
refining oils is referred to as solvent extraction and a full description of
this process is not for the faint of heart or stomach. The process includes
extreme heat, hexane-based solvents, bleaching and deodorization. The process
damages the fats in the oil to the extent that the oil is often rancid before
it is even sold. Not only is our oil extracted from a simple cold press, but it
is made from non-GMO seed sourced 30 percent from local farms.</p>

<p>Finally, our cranberries contain <strong>no artificial color or
preservatives</strong> typical of commercially processed cranberries and retain
the dark rich color, tart flavor and moist taste of the original cranberry.</p>

<p>Below is a complete list of our ingredients. Note that our recipe does not
contain nuts and the kitchen we use is designated nut-free.</p>
